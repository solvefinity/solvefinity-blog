## A Sweet Real-World Challenge

Candy is sold by **weight**, not by **number of pieces**—but when you’re planning for hundreds of students, that difference matters.

In this *Math Is Messy* task, students reason about how many candies might come in a 4-lb, 5-lb, or 8-lb box when the package doesn’t list piece counts. They make assumptions, estimate, and test their models to decide how much to buy for an event serving 350 students.

## Why This Task Works

This activity builds number sense and reasoning rather than focusing on exact computation. Students:
- Use unit rates and proportional reasoning to make sense of messy, real data.  
- Debate assumptions (equal mix by type, weight, or count).  
- Communicate and justify their modeling choices.  

Because it’s context-neutral—no direct mention of Halloween—you can use it any time of year when exploring estimation or modeling.

## Extend the Discussion

- Compare chocolate vs fruity mixes by price per pound.  
- Explore fairness: what does “equal” mean when pieces differ in size or value?  
- Connect to data science: how could sampling or simulation improve your estimate?
