<h3>What is design thinking?</h3>
<p>Design thinking is a problem-solving framework that encourages creativity, iteration, and human-centered solutions.
Instead of following rigid steps, students and educators explore different approaches, refine their thinking,
and embrace failure as a stepping stone to deeper understanding.

Whether in math or educational technology, design thinking puts the learner at the center,
valuing flexibility, exploration, and real-world problem-solving.</p>

### Why design thinking matters in math

Too often, math is presented as a series of fixed procedures leading to a single right answer. But in real-world applications—whether in engineering, data science, or finance. Problems are rarely that straightforward. Students need to learn how to define problems, identify missing information, test ideas, and adjust their approach when things don’t work out.

Math should be messy because that’s how real problem-solving happens. Instead of seeing struggle as a sign of failure, students should see it as an opportunity to refine their thinking. When we teach students that math is about exploring, not just solving, we prepare them to be critical thinkers.
