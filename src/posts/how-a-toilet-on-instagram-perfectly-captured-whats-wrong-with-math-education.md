    <h3>THE TOILET THAT STARTED IT ALL</h3>
    <p>A while back, I saw an Instagram video that made me laugh—and made me think. </p>

<!--StartFragment-->

A man is standing in the plumbing aisle of a hardware store, staring at two different toilet models. One claims it can flush a bucket of golf balls. Another boasts it can flush seven billiard balls. He looks at the camera, baffled, and says:

“So… what’s better? A bucket of golf balls or seven billiard balls? How am I supposed to figure that out?”

It’s funny at first. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized: this is exactly the kind of uncertain, open-ended problem we almost never give students in math class.
