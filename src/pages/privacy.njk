    <h2>Legal bases (EEA/UK visitors)</h2>
    <p>Where applicable, we rely on <strong>legitimate interests</strong> (operate/secure the site, measure usage, respond to messages) and <strong>consent</strong> (newsletter).</p>

    <h2>What we don’t do</h2>

    <p>Data may be processed in the U.S. or other countries by our providers. We use appropriate safeguards (e.g., standard contractual clauses) where required.</p>

    <h2>Your rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing. Use the <a href="/contact/">Contact page</a> to reach us; we’ll respond within required timeframes.</p>
